# ASAP Collaboration Network Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline supporting the research report:

> **Gupta, M. & Gates, A.**  
> *Collaboration patterns in the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s (ASAP) research network*

The package provides tools for constructing, analyzing, and visualizing collaboration networks derived from ASAP-supported research outputs. It is designed to support transparent, reproducible analysis of scientific collaboration structures and knowledge flows within mission-driven research networks.

## Overview

Large, coordinated research initiatives such as ASAP are explicitly designed to reshape collaboration patterns, accelerate discovery, and promote cross-disciplinary exchange. This repository implements the computational methods used in the accompanying report to:

- Construct researcher-level and team-level collaboration networks  
- Quantify structural features of collaboration (e.g., connectivity, concentration, redundancy)  
- Characterize how collaboration patterns vary across time, institutions, and program components  
- Support comparative and longitudinal analyses of scientific networks  

The codebase is modular and intended both for reproducing the results in the report and for extension to other collaborative research programs.
